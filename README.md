# code-quiz-
Come play my quiz game that has questions involving writing code for beginers. 
Users have four options per question, when the game begins a timer starts a countdown from 75. 
If you get the question wrong the timer will be subtracted by 5 seconds. 
If the question is answered correctly the time wont change. The end of the game will record the score of the current time.
You can save your highscore to local storage, and check the high scores list, where you are offered the options to clear the highscores or play again.
